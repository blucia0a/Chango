Chango is a program that functions as a musical instrument.  The program
creates a grid of squares on the screen.  Each square emits a tone.  Your mouse
'activates' a square.  This will change its color (for the player to see what's
happening), and will change the volume of the tone being emitted by that
square.  The degree of activation depends on the distance that your mouse cursor is from the square's center.  Dead-center is 100%, and the activation tapers off with increased distance.
